# INTRO TO PHYSICAL SCIENCE BOT:

Virtual assistant is rarely applied in school to help professors and students.

By using TTS (text to speech) libraries like "pyttsx3" or "gTTS", professors can create a virtual assistant to help students.
This app created a virtual assistant bot to help students study Introductory of Physical Science.
Most of important answers first come from professor's list of designated answers. If student asks a question out of that list, bot will use answer from wikipedia.

This app works fine in localhost, however, streamlit and heroku have problem to find required libraries from localhost. So currently, it does not work online as
